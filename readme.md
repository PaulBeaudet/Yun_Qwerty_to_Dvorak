# USB Qwerty to "your layout" converter

This is a project specifically designed for the Arduino Yun board. A USB keyboard is plugged into the Yun and the micro USB on the Yun into a computers. The code included with this project converts specifically the standard Qwerty keyboard layout to Dvorak for the author's convenience but it can be adapted to other layouts.

The code base has been adapted from two separate pieces of code developed by Micah Dowty (evdev.py) and a code example provided by Robin2 on the Arduino forums - http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=319151.0

The later of which has been helpful to start but will likely completely be re-adapted to work asynchronously
